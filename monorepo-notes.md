# Notes for developing the monorepo

## package.json

### LocusZoom

* locuszoom

### IGVBrowser

* requires ambient_types
* lodash.get, lodash.merge, lodash.noop, lodash.find (& @types for each)
* igv: `https://github.com/NIAGADS/igv.js.git#NIAGADS`

### Gosling

* react 18 (unsure about 19 support)
* higlass
* gosling.js
* pixi.js

### Table

* export-from-json (also referenced in common/types, but probably should just be moved to Table)
* @tanstack/react-table

### Charting

* highcharts? TBD

## Considerations

## next.js 'client' components

* should we put in `"use client"` directive or should we assume that anyone doing next-js development will wrap the component? will the directive be problematic for rollup/eslinting outside of next-js?  seems OK in the storybook
* may need to remove from components (e.g., table, igvbrowser) reimported from niagads-api-client

## Tasks / Issues to create (notes for EGA)

## IGVBRowser

* `FEATURE_INFO_BASE_URL` will need to be set as IGVBrowser component property and passed into the browser config so that it can be accessed by the track parsers and renderers
* ditto for `FEATURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`
* `url` and `indexURL` for `Ensembl Gene track` need to be updated; maybe put GenomicsDB raw file in FILER?
* review functions exported in each file
* there are some serious issues w/the IGVBrowser component now that development branch was merged in.  Review and clean up
